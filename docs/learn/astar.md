# About Astar Network

[Astar Network]: https://astar.network/ 

Astar Network is Japan's most popular smart contract platform, supporting both EVM and WebAssembly (Wasm) environments, and interoperability between them using a proprietary Cross-Virtual Machine, and cross-chain messaging protocols. 

At Astar, we are on a mission to revolutionize the internet. We envision a future where it is truly decentralized, and not controlled by a handful of tech giants. We believe the internet should be free and owned by the people for the people. We believe that people should have ownership of their data and assets, and not be at the mercy of intermediaries. This is the essence of the web3 vision and what drives Astar.

Backed by the shared security of Polkadot on one side, and Ethereum's market dominance on the other, Astar shines brilliantly on its own within these vibrant and healthy ecosystems, and in the blockchain industry overall driving international corporate adoption and consumer interest in web3 technologies.

While we are building a web3 for billions, we are focused on providing solutions to a few key challenges:

## Addressing a lack of developer incentives
 
Astar's Unstoppable grants program is an innovative system designed to grow the network while simultaneously rewarding builders and participants. It allows developers to earn incentives for building and maintaining their decentralized applications, and users to earn incentives for supporting their favorite projects, all while encouraging growth of the ecosystem overall.

## Scalability

Blockchains do not scale by design, mostly due to the security assurances inherent in their decentralized consensus mechanisms. If blockchains were faster, they would be less decentralized and resilient. 

There is an upper limit to the amount of data that can be stored in individual blocks on any given blockchain, and at times of network saturation, users of popular blockchains may notice their transactions sitting unconfirmed or in a pending state for long periods of time, resulting in a poor user experience. 

Astar Network is changing that, and ushering in the next generation of multichain smart contracts uniquely able to utilize the best features from both EVM-based and WebAssembly Virtual Machines on Ethereum Layer 2, our Polkadot parachain, and any number of application-specific blockchains across the broader Polkadot ecosystem. We are future-proof!

## Addressing a poor user experience (UX)

Web3, in its traditional usage, is known particularly for its poor user experience (UX) that is seen as less than ideal for several reasons:

1. A steep learning curve. Users have to manage their public and private keys, which can be daunting for those not familiar with blockchain technology. Astar Network provides account abstraction and key management solutions. 

2. Complicated prerequisites to onboard. Networks generally require holding a certain amount of gas for transactions in the chain-native token, which can fluctuate greatly depending on network congestion. Astar has a number of gasless payment and gas sponsorship options for developers that, when combined with account abstraction, provide a modern web3 experience that is friendly to existing social media and mobile phone users, allowing for seemingly *walletless* or *accountless* interaction with web3 dApps and marketplaces, without requiring the chain-native token.

3. Stalled transactions and high gas fees. During periods of high demand, blockchain networks can become congested, leading to slower transaction times. Astar network, as a Layer 2 on Ethereum and parachain on Polkadot, are not subject to traditional bottlenecks that plague other blockchains.

4. Absence of typical web2 recovery systems. Let's face it - people forget their passwords **all the time**. The need to manage private keys poses even greater security risks. Users can and often do lose access to their funds when they lose, forget, or have their private keys stolen. This level of responsibility can be stressful, especially for users who are not technically inclined. We are changing this on Astar. Now developers can build in social recovery options and key management systems to their dApps and wallets, providing peace of mind for average users that are used to being able to click **forgot password?** when things go wrong.

5. Immutability of transactions. Well, there are some things that *even we* can't fix ðŸ˜‚! Such is the nature of distributed ledger and blockchain technology; that we cannot erase what's already been written, but this is actually one of the things that makes it great, and we wouldn't want it any other way.

## Addressing a lack of Interoperability

Astar's interoperability framework allows developers to use and build smart contracts in ways they never have before. By fostering cooperation and integration across multiple blockchains and infrastructure providers, complex solutions can be developed, leading to the realization of truly innovative solutions and smart contracts that can't simply be copied and pasted to any other environment.

Many different blockchains exist, but few if any of them have built-in developer incentives, interoperability, and the ability to make user experiences transparent as their defining features. Welcome to Astar Network.
