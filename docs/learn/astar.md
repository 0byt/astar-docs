# About Astar Network

[Astar Network]: https://astar.network/ 

Astar Network is Japan's most popular smart contract platform, supporting both EVM and WebAssembly (Wasm) environments, and interoperability between them using a proprietary Cross-Virtual Machine as well as cross-chain messaging protocols. 

Astar Network is friendly to all kinds of developers, and tools and languages they already know from Ethereum and other ecosystems. Backed by the shared security of Polkadot on one side, and Ethereum's overall dominance on the other, Astar shines brilliantly on its own within these vibrant and healthy ecosystems, and in the blockchain industry overall driving international corporate adoption and consumer interest in web3 technologies.

While we build a web3 for billions, we are focused on providing solutions to the following key challenges:

## Addressing a lack of developer incentives
 
Astar's Unstoppable grants program is an innovative system designed to grow the network while simultaneously rewarding builders and participants. It allows developers to earn incentives for building and maintaining their decentralized applications, and users to earn incentives for supporting their favorite projects, all while encouraging growth of the ecosystem overall.

## Scalability

Blockchains do not scale by design, mostly due to the security assurances inherent in their decentralized consensus mechanisms. If blockchains were faster, they would be less decentralized and resilient. 

There is an upper limit to the amount of data that can be stored in individual blocks on any given blockchain, and at times of network saturation, users of popular blockchains may notice their transactions sitting unconfirmed or in a pending state for long periods of time, resulting in a poor user experience. 

Astar Network is changing that, and ushering in the next generation of multichain smart contracts uniquely able to utilize the best features from both EVM-based and WebAssembly Virtual Machines on both Ethereum Layer 2 and on any number of application-specific blockchains across the broader Polkadot ecosystem. We are future-proof.

## Addressing a lack of Interoperability

Astar's interoperability framework allows developers to use and build smart contracts in ways they never have before. By fostering cooperation and integration across multiple blockchains and infrastructure providers, complex solutions can be developed, leading to the realization of truly innovative solutions and smart contracts that can't simply be copied and pasted to any other environment.

Many different blockchains exist, but few have interoperability as a defining feature. Welcome to Astar Network.

## Poor User Experience (UX)

Web3, in its traditional usage, is known particularly for its poor user experience (UX) that is seen as less than ideal for several reasons:

1. Users have to manage their public and private keys, which can be daunting for those not familiar with blockchain technology. Astar Network provides account abstraction and key management solutions. 

2. Networks generally require holding a certain amount of gas for transactions in the chain-native token, which can fluctuate greatly depending on network congestion. Astar provides gasless payment and gas sponsorship options.

3. During periods of high demand, blockchain networks can become congested, leading to slower transaction times. Astar network, as a Layer 2 on Ethereum and parachain on Polkadot, are not subject to traditional bottlenecks that plague other blockchains.

4. The need to manage private keys poses significant security risks. Users can and often do lose access to their funds when they lose their private keys or if they are stolen. This level of responsibility can be stressful, especially for users who are not technically inclined. We are changing this through social recovery options and key management services provided by our partners.

Users typically need to use external wallets to interact with EVM-based applications. This requirement can be cumbersome, as it involves managing additional software and sometimes hardware.
