# Getting Started

Astar is a collection of networks and tools providing:

- native support for Wasm and EVM-compatable smart contracts,
- advanced cross-chain features through Polkadot's XCMP,
- and developer tooling for writing Wasm smart contracts in ink! (Rust-like syntax) and ask! (TypeScript-like syntax)


## Overview of Docs

- [**Quick Start**](quickstart) gives you the resources you need to get started
testing, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts on the network.
- [**EVM**](evm) explains how to use EVM on Astar and how to interact with other non-EVM modules through [precompiles](evm/precompiles).
- [**Wasm**](wasm) provides an [overview of ink! and ask!](wasm/ink-ask.md)  Wasm contract frameworks, [developer tooling](wasm/dev-tooling), examples for each, and compiling [Solidity to Wasm](wasm/solidity-to-wasm).
- [**Nodes**](nodes) explains how to run full nodes, collators, indexers, and everything you need to know related to infrastructure.
- [**XCM**](xcm) shares the different ways to XCM on Astar to interact with the rest of the Polkadot networks.
- [**Integrations**](integrations) provide relevant information about the [wallets](integrations/wallets), [bridges](integrations/bridges), [indexers](integrations/indexers), and [oracles](integrations/oracles) that are integrated with the network.
