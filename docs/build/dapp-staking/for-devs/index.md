# For Developers

## Overview

Are you a product owner and want to list your dApp in our staking mechanism to earn rewards? You have to make sure you meet the requirements. Read more about those by clicking on the links below.

Please take the following parameters into consideration:

- To register a dApp for dApp staking requires 100 SDN tokens or 1000 ASTR tokens depending on the network the project is joining. DApp staking on Shibuya testnet requires 100 SBY.

:::note
**DApp staking rewards are not claimed or restaked automatically without  manual initiation.** 

Due to the introduction of expiring rewards in dApp staking v3, it is recommended that rewards be claimed at least once a week, or at very minimum once per election period to avoid penalties.**
