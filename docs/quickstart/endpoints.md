# Network endpoints

## Public Endpoints

There are public endpoints available for development but for Astar or Shiden, you'll need to get your own endpoint from one of the supported [](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers)providers. You can always run your own RPC nodes.

**Astar is not responsible for your project downtime in case of public endpoint issues.**
